# Hirst Painting with Turtle 🐢🎨

A collection of Python scripts exploring generative art using the `turtle` graphics library. This project culminates in a recreation of Damien Hirst’s famous "Spot Paintings" by extracting color palettes from images.

## 🌟 Features

This repository includes several mini-projects that demonstrate different geometry and randomization techniques:

### 1. The Hirst Spot Painting
The flagship script of this repo. It uses the `colorgram` library to extract a palette from a `.jpg` image and then paints a 10x10 grid of dots using those specific RGB values.


### 2. The Spirograph
A mathematical art piece that draws overlapping circles. By shifting the "heading" of the turtle by a small degree (e.g., $5^\circ$) after each circle, it creates a complex radial pattern.


### 3. The Random Walk
A script that mimics a "drunken" path. The turtle moves in random directions (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) with a thick pen size and randomized RGB colors, creating a unique modern art piece every time it runs.

### 4. Polygon Layering
Draws a sequence of geometric shapes (triangle, square, pentagon, etc., up to a decagon) layered on top of each other, where each shape is assigned a random color from a predefined list.
